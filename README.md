# What is Neovim(nvim), really?
Neovim is a fork of vim which integrates LSP client and lua api for configuration and plugin creation. \
With the help of the lua integration, nvim's amazing community created a diverse [plugin ecosystem](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim) which feels designed right, robust, scalable and replaceable.

## I already know vim I just want to learn nvim
Great, you can skip half the guide :) \
Read [Chapter 8 - Personal Config vs Preconfigured Configuration](./chapters/08-advanced-config.md) go back to [Chapter 2](./chapters/02-basic-config.md) and then skip to [Chapter 8](./chapters/08-advanced-config.md).

# Why did I write this guide?
I started to use nvim in early 2022 after using sublime for about 6 years, I felt sublime was left behind pluginwise and it's not really competing with the features VSCode had to offer, I tried to use VSCode and after a week I understood it's not fitting for me, as it forced me to use my mouse more than often. I decided to give nvim a try, and it ended up as the best decision I made.

I didn't understand where to start from, should I learn vim first? how do I configure nvim? which plugins from the many many plugins do I need to use?

I wanted to make a guide that covers the basics of vim, gives the tools to learn vim (the fishing rod instead of the fish), and one that helps you to configure nvim.
