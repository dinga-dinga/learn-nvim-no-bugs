# What is really Neovim(nvim)?
Neovim is a fork of vim which integrates lsp client and lua api for configuration and plugin creation. \
Because of the lua integration nvim amazing community created an amazing [plugin ecosystem](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim) which feels designed right, robust, scalable, replaceable.

## I already know vim I just want to learn nvim
Great you can skip half of the guide :) \
Read [Chapter 8 - Personal Config vs Preconfigured Configuration](./chapters/08-advanced-config.md) go back to [Chapter 2](./chapters/02-basic-config.md) and then skip to [Chapter 8](./chapters/08-advanced-config.md)

# Why I wrote this guide?
I started to use nvim at start of 2022, after using sublime for about 6 years, I felt sublime has been left behind pluginwise and its not really competing with the features vscode had to offer, I tried to use vscode and after a week I understood it isn't for me, it forced me to use my mouse so much time. I decided to give nvim a try, it was the best decision I took.

I didn't understand where to start from, should I learn vim first? how do I configure nvim? which plugins from the many many plugins I need to use?

I want to make a guide that covers the basics of vim, gives the tools to learn vim (the fishing rod instead of the fish), and a guide that helps you configure nvim.
